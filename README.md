# CHGNN-PTP

The code will be made public after the manuscript is accepted!

See you later!


## Code Structure
checkpoint folder: contains the trained models

dataset folder: contains ETH, UCY and SDD datasets

model.py: the code of PCHGCN

test.py: for testing the code

utils.py: general utils used by the code

metrics.py: Measuring tools used by the code

The specific code of the training part will be released after the paper is officially published!

## Model Evaluation
You can easily run the modelÔºÅ To use the pretrained models at checkpoint/ and evaluate the models performance run:  test.py

## Acknowledgement
